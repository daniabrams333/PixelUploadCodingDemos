This repo is from my time at the Apple Developer Academy for our Challenge 5 project - Making a Game. In order to learn the coding skills to make a game myself and the other coder on our team did a lot of research on:
1. SpriteKit
2. General Game Physics and Basics
3. Other SwiftUI software frameworks and architecture.
